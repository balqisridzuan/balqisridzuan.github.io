<h4>Experience</h4>
<div id="stories">
<p class="b"> There are numerous experiences that we will be going through as our ages will be older,
more moments will be acquired. There are ups and downs, sometimes it will be overwhelming that
it will be cherished and remembered eternally. On this section, we will be going through 2
experiences that I find it truly unforgettable.</p>	
<ol>
<li><h2>Happiest</h2></li>
<p class="b"> On my happiest experience, to initate it, I was a student who finds education is nothing but mere
essential that all of us need to went through on our way becoming adults. When I was younger, education
do affected me when the fond and proud smiles from my parents appear whenever i went home with a happy news.
However, it all starts when I was in highschool, things went downward, I felt unmotivated, puberty came through
and all I wanted was enjoyment as a teenager. No more smiles and fond words coming from my parents. I became rebellious,
as I started to become from'something' to 'nothing'.
<br>
<br>
After years of being 'nothing', my life has changed entirely when my family and I moved to Johor. I have nobody,
new friends and environment to adapt with. Back in my previous school, I was still a nobody to teachers, I never
caught their attention, even never excelling in the studies. When I moved to a new school, on last
year as a highschool student, I went to SMK Tanjung Puteri Resort, Pasir Gudang, Johor, a school in a rural area.
I was raised and born in a city, never been in my life to expect myself to be living in a rural area.
Eventually, after months of adapting and finally being comfortable in my current zone, I realized so many things changed
after I have been here. The teachers were all so nice, as the school is only consists of nearly 900 students, teachers able
to give concentration on each of the students well. More than that, I received a tremendous attention and care from the teachers,
I feel appreciated, end up decided to change myself to be a better person. I finally slowly start to be old self again. I have never been
more happier. 
<br>
<br>
Eventually, as the most important part of highschool passed, which was SPM, I did well, prepared myself to face it confidently, unlike
back then. On the day of the result of the examination, I expected myself to achieve enough that able to satisfies myself barely. However, 
when the announcement of the best student has been called, my name appeared. Never in my life to expect myself to succeed after going through
numerous of failures for the past few years. I saw my mom cheering and crying of happiness, the last time I saw that was over 5 years ago. On that 
moment, I find myself utterly grateful on my mom especially, on her existence, her never-ending support even when I was on my lowest. I thought to myself,
"I did it", I finally did it, I made my parents proud again, I made their day on the urge of happiness after disappointing them continously. This moment
was one of my greatest highlight of my life, I see the happiness through my parents, I have never been more happier on that day. Ever since that day, I promised
myself to keep on being this way for the happiness of both of them.</p>
<br>
<li><h2>Saddest</h2></li> 
<p class="b"> In contrast of my previous experience, there are indeed the sad and devastated part in our life. 
As for me, the saddest experience I went through when I was only 8 years old. For your information, I was the eldest child, the
only girl in the siblings, on 2008, I was in school, as I suddenly saw my mom came to my class to pick me up. Her expression seems
to be nothing serious on the reason why she had to pick me. Unfortunately, as we were stepping out from my class,
my mother broke her character and cried while hugging me. She said "Ayah is at the hospital, he got heart attack, he's in critical condition". 
On that moment,as a kid, I was in a total confusion, I was thinking, "Is Ayah was sick?Then why does Mama cried terribly?". After arriving
at the hospital, a doctor assist my family and I, we saw my dad, he was in the emergency section, a lot of people
surround him, he looks unconscious. My mom was breaking apart, and finally I realized, "Ayah is not sick, he's dying." I saw my mom, I cried badly,
so bad until there are no tears left.
<br>
<br>
My mom suffered for a month and a half, taking care of my dad without any support. My aunty willingly took my siblings and I as she was taking care of
us to lessen my mom's burden. As I said before, we were bunch of kids, we easily forgotten on something and I was happy living with my aunty. Finally,
after a long time, my parents came to my aunty's house. My dad was finally discharged from the hospital. He was a strong man. Now, after I grown up and finally
understand everything, I constantly being grateful to Allah SWT, for giving a chance to my dad, to my family,
for us to live happily again. Seeing the one who we truly loved, breaking apart in front of us is nothing but brings us
true devastation. I imagined every single one of bad circumstances if we ever not seeing my dad anymore. Ever since that moment, my entire life changed, I finally
knew how much important my family is to me.</p>
