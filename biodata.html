<h4>Dear Balqis,</h4>
<div id="stories">
<p class="b">My name is Nur Balqis Binti Ridzuan,
I am 20 years old and was born in Puchong, Selangor on 15 of August 2000.
Currently living in Cyberjaya, Selangor with family and it has been over 2 years since we moved from Puchong.
I am a Library Management student, currently studying in 
<abbr title="Universiti Teknologi MARA">UiTM</abbr> Kedah, on my last semester of Diploma.
<br>
<br>
As I was born in Puchong, Selangor, as the first child, my parents and I were living in a small home, enough for all 3 of us. 
On 2002, we moved to Sungai Petani, Kedah as we were living at Laguna Merbok, coincidentally, a town where I am currently studying at.
We lived there for over 3 years, after my younger brother was born, we moved back to Puchong, Selangor as my dad bought the first house that is
big enough for the family that is growing. I started my kindergarten, and my first elementary school was at SK Puchong Utama 1. I considered myself living in
a 'circle', as my second elementary school (which I moved when I was in my last year), at SK Puchong Utama 2, as I decided it on my own, because I was embarrassed on
my Standard 5 results and disappoint my parents. Finally, after went for a journey in elementary school, I went to SMK Puchong Utama 1, and eventually, on the same situation,
but different year, on my last year as a highschool student, my dad was transferred to Johor. Our whole family moved to Pasir Gudang, Johor as I was Form 5, sadly
accepting the fate that I have to face my last year in a new school. My last school was in SMK Tanjung Puteri Resort. As I was born and living in a city in my entire life,
this place feels so odd initially. However, after successfully adapting on this new environment, I feel much better and happier with my new friends and home.
<br>
<br>
Finally, after living nearly 2 years at Johor, we went back to Puchong and after having and living in a home in Puchong over a decade and a half,
my parents decided that as their children are growing up, it is their time on letting go the house as we started our new life in Cyberjaya, Selangor. 
<br>
As for me, after going through <abbr title="Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia">SPM</abbr>, I have received an offer in furthering on Diploma in Library Management in UiTM Kedah.
Honestly, I never felt way more heartbroken, as I am dreaming in furthering my studies in Law. Fortunately, after nearly 2 years, now, I have never been more
grateful on my decision. As I am currently on my last semester, I have been planning on pursuing my studies on Library Science soon.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, if you are curious what kind of person I am? Well, I am a friendly person as I tend to approach on everyone easily. 
I am able to adapt on anyone even each of them having different behaviours. My friends tend to see as someone who pretty much hyper and 
a happy-go-lucky type of person. My current classmates do see me as someone who overdressed on every single day, yes I do enjoy fashion and makeup genuinely.
Back then, I was timid in presentation or even communicating with teachers as most of them do not even know me well. Now, I am much comfortable in communicating and
presenting infront of classes and lecturers. I find myself improving day by day. From a teenage girl who went through challenges a long with a sigh constantly, and now a young adult
who has accepted her fate along with a smile constantly.
<br>
<br>
This is me, Balqis.</p>
